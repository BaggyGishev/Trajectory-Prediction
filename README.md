# Trajectory Prediction
  
Created this simple Trajectory Prediction prototype, because I thought it would be interesting to implement physics simulation of a projectile.

Interactions are simple: you rotate turret and you shoot to hit a star.

## What I Learned
* Creating a physics simulation
* Creating and managing several scenes at runtime

## Controls
* W,S - Rotation around X axis
* A,D - Rotation around Y axis
* LMB - Shoot
